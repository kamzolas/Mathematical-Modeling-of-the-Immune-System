# Antibody-Antigen Matching Using Genetic Algorithms in MATLAB

Every biological organism has an immune system that defends it against antigens—foreign substances such as pathogenic microorganisms. This defence is carried out by antibodies, the immune system’s "soldiers", which recognise and neutralise antigens.
However, there is a major challenge: the number of antibody species (~10⁸) is vastly outnumbered by the potential number of antigen species (~10²⁴). This means that each antibody must be able to recognise multiple antigens, and each antigen may interact with numerous antibodies.

This project uses genetic algorithms implemented in MATLAB to simulate and optimise the interaction between antibodies and antigens. Starting from a predefined antigen bank, the algorithm evolves a population of antibodies to find configurations that are as complementary as possible to a wide variety of antigen species.
